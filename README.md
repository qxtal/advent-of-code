# My ‘Advent of Code’ Submissions
These are my submissions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles. They're mostly written in Python, but I also might try other languages. We'll see.

Please don't expect any fancy hacks, tricks or extreme optimizations here. I just do this for fun, and I'm no super-genius über hacker or something. I mostly just focus on making code that's readable, understandable and does the job of solving the puzzles.

## License
The code here is licensed under the MIT license.

I'm open for people to use this code for their projects if they wish, and potentially learn from it. However, please do not use this code just to cheat in the event without any effort. Don't just copy the code fully as-is and then claim it as your own.

You can use the code here as hints, or even use it fully in your own personal projects. Just don't cheat in the AoC events. Please try and solve the puzzles yourself first.

If you use the code here, please keep the copyright/author notices. I'm no lawyer, but just don't be a dick by cheating, okay?
